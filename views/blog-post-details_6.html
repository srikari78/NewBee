               <br>

               <h3>What are the best Frontend Frameworks</h3>

               <h3>What are Frontend Frameworks?</h3>
<p>Before discussing the top Front-end Frameworks, let’s understand what Front-end frameworks are. To understand a Front end framework, we need to know what the front-end is. The front-end of a website or application is the stuff visible to the user on the website. The graphics, typography, and arrangement of these two are what contribute. In addition, it includes building user-friendly interfaces and efficiently presenting the data from the back end to a user.</p>
<p>Thus, a Front-end Framework is a platform/tool to build the front end of your website. Some of the tasks one can perform using a Front-end Framework are &#8211; the management of AJAX requests, associating data with The Document object Model (DOM) elements, defining a file structure, and styling of components on the website or application.</p>
<h3>Best front-end Frameworks in 2022</h3>
<p>When it comes to Frontend Frameworks for web development, there will always be debates regarding which among them is the best. However, after researching the recent studies and surveys about the most popular Front-end frameworks, we have come up with an explicit list of the best front-end frameworks for you. This list is prepared as per the surveys conducted by Github stars. </p>
<p>The ranking of these Frontend Frameworks for web development decides as per the following three crucial factors &#8211; </p>
<h3>Type of applications you can create with it </h3>
<p>One of the most important deciding factors in choosing a front-end framework is what type of application or website you want to create. Whether it is a large-scale application or a small-scale web application, the choice of a framework varies a lot. The most popular front-end frameworks for large-scale applications are &#8211; vue.js, react.js, angular, and smaller web applications &#8211; jquery and Backbone Js.</p>
<h3>The ease of learning and using</h3>
<p>With the growing popularity of the digital world, more and more new developers are emerging each passing day. Today, people believe in learning skills that are easy to learn and can help them earn a good living. Therefore, newly emerging front-end developers prefer learning the frameworks that are easy to learn and use and have all the features needed. For example &#8211; Reactjs, Vuejs, and Backbonejs are some of the simplest and easiest frameworks to learn than the complex frameworks like angular.</p>
<h3>Developers Income</h3>
<p>If we think from a developer’s point of view, we’ll prefer the framework that earns us the most. That’s right! Developers working on different frameworks have different earnings. For example, a detailed discussion on front-end frameworks and a Q&#038;A on the website <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2016" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a> revealed that <strong>front-end developers</strong> working on Reactjs and Nodejs frameworks earn $95,000 &#8211; $105,000 on average. Therefore most developers prefer learning and opting for React.js to develop the Front-end of a website.</p>
<p>Now that we know what Front-end Frameworks actually are and what they are used to discuss the best front-end frameworks in 2022. So, if you a front-end developer or simply looking to <a href="https://technostacks.com/hire-front-end-developer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hire a dedicated front-end developer</a>, you’ll know what framework is your go-to option.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://reactjs.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>React</strong></a><br />
Considering how easy it is to learn and how much money a ReactJs Front-end developer makes, ReactJs could easily steal the number one spot for the best Front-end Framework. Now an open-source framework, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library)" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">React was originally developed by Facebook’s team</a>. </p>
<p>Facebook was an emerging app and needed constant additions and improvements, making it hard to fix and maintain the coding part. React allowed them to make changes to the code easily. The unique thing about react is the Virtual Document Object Model (DOM) with exceptional functionality.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>React is easy to learn and use.</li>
<li>React allows you to reuse an already built component in your code. This way, it’s easier to collaborate and use these components in other parts of the application.</li>
<li>Use of its virtual DOM allows a seamless performance and ensures that even high-load applications have fast rendering.</li>
<li>Increased productivity and maintenance. New changes in the application can be easily made.</li>
<li>It has a browser extension named <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">React Developer Tools</a>, which allows them to make detailed observations of their components and make them better.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the initial phases of learning React, it can be difficult for the developers to understand the concepts of JSX.</li>
<li>ReactJS is used for developing only the UI part of the application. Therefore, to get complete development tools, you will have to rely on other technologies.</li>
<li>As the components can be easily updated at high speed, it isn’t easy to maintain proper documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Applications</strong><br />
React is mostly used for developing single-page applications. However, it is a framework specifically used for User Interface development. It comes in quite handy when you require building an interactive interface for an application within a limited time because you can reuse the components in this framework.</p>
<p><strong>Where can you not use React?</strong><br />
JSX is pretty tough when it comes to learning. Therefore, if you are a new developer, it’s recommended not to use React. Secondly, the knowledge of JavaScript is necessary for using React. In case you don’t know JavaScript, React is not the go-to option for you.</li>
<li><a href="https://angular.io/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>Angular</strong></a><br />
The only of the many Front-end Frameworks in 2022 based on TypeScript, Angular makes its spot on this list. Angular was initially released in the year 2010 by Google as AngularJs. The now known version of the Framework (Angular 2+) was developed and deployed in 2016, keeping in mind the need for improved technology to overcome the hurdles faced by the conventional Frameworks. Similar to ReactJs, it is an open-source platform used to develop user interfaces on the front end. </p>
<p><strong>Also read:-</strong> <a href="https://technostacks.com/blog/react-vs-angular/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">React vs Angular: Which Is A Better JavaScript Framework?</a></p>
<p>The one main difference between React and Angular is that Angular has a two-way binding feature. The presence of this feature allows the integration of any changes made in the model with the view. This way, a developer would see what changes they are making in the application and how it looks in real-time.</p>
<p>Angular usually deals with the development of mobile and web applications. Not just that, but one can easily build both single and multi-page web applications. Due to its various features, Angular is opted by some of the biggest companies in the world, including Microsoft Office, BMW, Forbes, Gmail, and Upwork.</p>
<p>Although Angular has better features when compared to React, it is not easy to learn. The framework is a bit complex and thus takes time to excel at.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The in-built functionality of this framework allows real-time model-view synchronization and makes it easier to make any changes to the application.</li>
<li>The presence of Directives allows the developers to play around with the Document Object Model (DOM) and create rich content using HTML.</li>
<li>Dependency injectors allow the developers to decouple interdependent components of code and reuse these components however they need.</li>
<li>Angular gained popularity among the developers since it was launched. Today, there’s a big community of web developers who use Angular. A developer can easily seek help from this community if he faces an issue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The wide variety of features and built-in functionalities make Angular a very complex language to learn.</li>
<li>Dynamic applications can lag sometimes and may not perform upto the mark.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Applications</strong><br />
Angular is the go-to option for most enterprise-based and dynamic web applications due to its two-way data binding that allows browser-based applications to augment.</p>
<p><strong>When Can you not use Angular?</strong><br />
Angular is the complete dynamic solution as a Framework. Thus, if you want to build small-scale web applications, you may not want to opt for angular because you would not utilize its resources to the best. It would merely be a misuse of time and resources. Furthermore, if you are a new developer with a small team, you should avoid using the complex Frameworks like Angular.</li>
<li><a href="https://vuejs.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>VueJs</strong></a><br />
The developers of VueJs have combined the existing Front-end Frameworks’ best features to deploy a simple and straightforward framework. </p>
<p>Firstly, it is not complex like Angular, which makes it easy to learn and use. Secondly, it is much smaller in size and similar to Angular, offers two-way binding, Visual DOM, and component-based programming.</p>
<p>VueJs is a framework that allows you to build both dynamic and small web applications with ease. However, despite being versatile, it is not yet popular among big-scale companies. This is because most large-scale companies still trust Angular for enterprise-based web applications. Some of the companies that use VueJs are Alibaba, 9gag, and Xiaomi.</p>
<p><strong>Also read:-</strong> <a href="https://technostacks.com/blog/javascript-frameworks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Best JavaScript Frameworks Recommended By JS Communities</a></p>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>	Availability of detailed documentation for learners.</li>
<li>Supports the development of both complex dynamic applications and simpler smaller applications.</li>
<li>The syntax of this framework is very simple and thus easier to work with.</li>
<li>Presence of a virtual DOM.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Vue, being in high demand in China, has many of its documentation built-in Chinese, which creates a language barrier for people accessing these documents outside of China.</li>
<li>VueJs is still in its growing stages and thus does not have a large community.</li>
<li>VueJs provides a wide range of features, but it’s not as big as React or Angular.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Applications &#8211;</strong><br />
VueJs is suggested to be used for projects that need greater flexibility. You can design everything from scratch and therefore allows designing dynamic applications with more ease.</p>
<p><strong>When not to use &#8211;</strong><br />
Despite having a wide range of features, VueJs is still not successful in creating stable components. Another reason why you wouldn’t want to opt for VueJs is if you’re looking for a community where you can seek help if you face any hurdles.</li>
<li><a href="https://jquery.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>JQuery</strong></a><br />
Since its development in 2006, JQuery has been around for quite some time now. Despite being an older Framework, it is still popular and widely used. Jquery is a very simple Framework that is easy to learn. With the framework, one doesn’t need to write extensive Javascript codes.<br />
The good thing is it is still used and is developing into a better version of itself each day. With the development of JQuery Mobile, one can easily develop mobile applications, which was not possible initially.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>JQuery is one of the simplest Frameworks out there. Even with very little programming language, one can easily use JQuery. This is the reason why it is still considered one of the best front-end frameworks in 2022. </li>
<li>Despite being a simple framework, it can still be used to deploy dynamic applications.</li>
<li>Components can be easily added or removed due to its flexible DOM.</li>
<li>An open-source platform that simplifies HTTP requests.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>JQuery is an older platform, and many new and better frameworks are available in the market today.</li>
<li>JQuery allows the development of dynamic applications but at a slower rate.</li>
<li>The lightweight interface of JQuery may lead to problems in the longer run</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Applications &#8211; </strong><br />
If you want to develop desktop-based javascript applications, JQuery is a go-to option.</p>
<p><strong>When not to use?</strong><br />
JQuery is not suggested for building large-scale applications because the excess javascript code might make your application heavy.</li>
<li><a href="https://emberjs.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>EmberJs</strong></a><br />
With its component-based functionality and two-way data binding, Ember resembles Angular a lot. It was developed in 2011 owing to the demands of modern technologies. Despite being one of the toughest Frameworks to learn, it is still used by some of the largest companies like Linkedin and Apple. This is because it allows the developers to develop complex mobile and web applications easily.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> 	It is one of the fastest Frameworks available in the market.</li>
<li>It provides two-way data binding.</li>
<li>A well-developed and fully packed Package ecosystem for all your needs.</li>
<li>It is backward compatible, so the older versions of applications will still work flawlessly despite new updates.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The learning curve of EmberJs is very steep.</li>
<li>It has a very complex syntax, and therefore working on it can be frustrating sometimes.</li>
<li>Building small applications on Ember might feel like a waste of a heavy Framework.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Applications &#8211;</strong><br />
Modern applications focused on deploying a rich user interface use EmberJs. Companies like Linkedin and Apple use it. </p>
<p><strong>When not to use &#8211;</strong><br />
EmberJs is not a preferable Framework for developing smaller applications because a lot of its resources won’t even be utilized. If you have a small team of developers, try to avoid using Ember because its initial cost is high, and it may not be the right choice for creating a simple user interface.</li>
